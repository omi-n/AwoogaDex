## Features
Not many, that's pretty much the whole point.
- Title Search
- Tag Search (only within the manga info page for now)
- Reader
- Pre-loads all manga images with the mangadex compressed image files.


## Why use this over MangaDex?
- I hated how the MangaDex web app worked on my mobile devices. I know there's Tachiyomi and Neko, but I don't want to install third party APKs all willy nilly all the time.
- I also just don't like the MangaDex reader on PC.
